# ArcPy-Manhole-Attribute-Transfer

A custom script in ArcMap that aids in survey data integration. This script transfers attributes from a surveyed manhole feature class into another manhole 
feature class, assumed to be an utility provider's feature class. Some editting will be required, particularly in the field names and setting a workspace.

This script was written in a Replica work environment, not a versioned environment. For versioned environments, the workspace is set to the server. Check within the Roaming folder:
  C:\Users\JohnDoe\AppData\Roaming\ESRI\Desktop10.6\ArcCatalog\
